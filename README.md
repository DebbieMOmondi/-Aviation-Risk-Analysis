# -Aviation-Risk-Analysis
This is my first data science project from Moringa School. Where i explore aviation accident data (1962â€“2023) to help a company identify low-risk aircrafts. Using Python, I apply data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to deliver insights through an interactive dashboard for business decisions.
